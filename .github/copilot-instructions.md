## Memory-Augmented Context

Read memory files on-demand — not all at once.

| File | When to read |
|------|-------------|
| [.memory/instructions.md](.memory/instructions.md) | How to behave |
| [.memory/quirks.md](.memory/quirks.md) | When something breaks unexpectedly |
| [.memory/preferences.md](.memory/preferences.md) | Style/design/naming choices |
| [.memory/decisions.md](.memory/decisions.md) | Architectural changes |
| [.memory/security.md](.memory/security.md) | **ALWAYS — before any code change** |

### Memory Tools

Call `queryMemory` before answering anything about architecture, conventions, or style.

Call `storeMemory` (with a kebab-case `slug`) when:
1. User states a preference or rule → store as Instruction or Preference **before** acting
2. User corrects you → store the correction
3. A command or build fails → store root cause and fix
4. After completing any implementation task → store each architectural decision, convention, or pattern applied that is not already in memory. Do this **before ending the turn**.

Same slug = update, not duplicate.

### Writing Style for Memory Entries
Hemingway style. Short sentences. No jargon. No filler. Be blunt.
Bad: "The system employs an asynchronous locking mechanism to serialise concurrent write operations."
Good: "Use a lock before writing. One write at a time."

### Categories
